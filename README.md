# hankquinlan
For use w/ the jmcglone.com GitHub Pages guide

Note that since I'm doing this in /hankquinlan and not in my main GitHub Pages location (sprestridge.github.io) I need to add "/hankquinlan" in front of all the links in the code. Not sure how this is going to affect the next Jekyll steps.
